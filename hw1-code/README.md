Homework 1

## Build instructions / code layout:

A6b consists of two python files: `mnist_classifier.py` and `mnist_helper.py`, the latter of which contains any other helpers that I might have needed or thought I needed.

To re-get results, simply run 
>python3 code/mnist_classifier.py

or
>python3 mnist_classifier.py

depending on where you are. This should print out the relevant errors and regenerate the plot in the /results folder.
